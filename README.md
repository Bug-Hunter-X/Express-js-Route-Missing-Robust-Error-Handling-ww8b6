# Express.js Route with Inadequate Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route that lacks proper handling for database errors and cases where a user is not found. This can lead to unexpected server behavior and unhelpful error messages for clients.  The improved version, `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates the correct implementation.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch a user from a database based on a provided ID. However, it fails to handle potential issues like:

1. **Database Errors:**  If a database query fails, the error is only logged to the console, not communicated to the client.
2. **User Not Found:** If a user with the specified ID does not exist, an uninformative message is sent.

## Solution

The solution addresses both issues by implementing comprehensive error handling:

1. **Catching Database Errors:** The updated code correctly handles database errors by sending a proper HTTP 500 status code and an informative error message.
2. **Handling Non-Existent Users:**  If a user is not found, a 404 status code with a clear message is returned.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
4. Run `node bug.js` to see the problematic version.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved version.
